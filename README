This project contains a series of functions to access joysticks in OSX for Simulink and Matlab.

To start, simply download the project and run setup.m in Matlab. The Mathworks FileExchange no longer allows distribution of binaries, so you will have to have a working XCode installation and have setup mex in Matlab to compile this project. If you are having trouble compiling this project, try using the provided makefile instead.
