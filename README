This project contains a series of functions to access joysticks in OSX for
Simulink and Matlab.

To start, simply download the project and run setup.m in Matlab. A
compatible compiler may be necessary unless you download this project from
the Mathworks FileExchange (in which case binaries should already be
packaged with the project).
